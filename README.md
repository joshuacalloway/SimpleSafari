# SimpleSafari
a simple ios swift project exploring the use of SFSafariViewController custom initializer on the Main.storyboard

The suggested way of using SFSafariViewController is coded in the SuggestedSafariViewController.swift
Please don't suggest this as the answer, as we know that it works this way.

Is there another solution to this problem using SimpleSafariViewController.swift
If no solution exists, then can we investigate as to how the Apple GODs coded the framework as to not make this possible?
